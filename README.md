## Project Overview
Using JavaScript and HTML we will develop a dynamic webpage that can interact with users.  The idea is to allow users to filter searches for UFO sightings using specific filters.  JavaScript, HTML, and bootstrap will power the query and generate the results.

## Results
Welcome, welcome to the UFO sightings webpage!!  We have constructed a database of UFO sightings for the UFO enthusiast!  Want to know how many times a UFO was sighted in mo?  Enter the abbreviation for Missouri (mo) and find out!

How about all sightings on a particular date?  No problem we can handle that too!  Just enter the date in the search field associated.  Learning and researching about UFOs is made easy on this site.  Curious about the different types of UFOs seen?  Filter your search results using the ‘Enter a Shape’ field and discover all the different shapes and colors UFO sighters have reported seeing with additional comments for clarity.  This is an awesome tool for researchers and hobbyists alike.  


## Summary
The fields for input provide an example of how the information should be inputted.  One drawback from this site, is that the string inputs need to be in lowercase.  A query ran for KS, generated no results, where a query of ks, generated results. To provide more value, making it easy to export the data into CSV could help the student retrieve the data for analysis later. A subtopic for this site could include abductions reported by citizens or an automatic engine that pulls the most recent sighting when the user lands on the webpage.
